LWE-Matrix 0.1 -- Learning-With-Errors-based Encryption System --
======================================================================

LWE-Matrix is an implementation of the LWE cryptosystem,
developed by Richard Lindner and Chris Peikert in "Better Key Sizes (and Attacks) 
for LWE-Based Encryption"(2010).
The program uses the Number Theory Library (NTL 5.5.2) of Shoup from http://www.shoup.net.

LWE-Matrix enables key generation, encryption and decryption of arbitrary files.
It is possible to use predefined cryptosystem modes (EASY, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) that
are from the publication of Lindner and Peikert. It is also possible to choose 
custom values for the parameters n, q and s.

Requirements:
=============

  * NTL <url:http://www.shoup.net>.
    
  * A sufficiently standard conforming C++ compiler.

SSR was developed and tested on 64-bit Linux system with NTL 5.5.2, GCC 4.4.3.


Installation:
=============

In the most simple cases, all you need to do is:

  1) unpack the distribution archive and make the resulting directory your
     working directory.
  2) change directory to 'src' and type 'make'
  3) LWE-Matrix is compiled to 'bin/'

USAGE:
=====
Usage: LWE-Matrix [OPTION] ...

-e,  --enc [Filename]   Encrypts a file with name "Filename".
                        The encrypted file takes postfix "*.enc" 
                        by default or you can choose your own 
                        filename with option "-o,  --out"

-d,  --dec [Filename]   Decrypts a file with name "Filename".
                        The filename of the decrypted file is either 
                        the current filename without optional 
                        postfix "*.enc" or you can choose 
                        your own filename with option "-o,  --out"

-g,  --genkey [Mode]   Generates a new pair of keys with 
                        given cipher mode. The predefined
                        modes are defined in the publication
                        "Better key sizes (and attacks) for
                        LWE-based encryption" of Lindner and Peikert.

                        ============================
                        EASY    128  2053  6.77
                        LOW     192  4093  8.87
                        MEDIUM  256  4093  8.35
                        HIGH    320  4093  8.00

                        For all modes above you can choose an 
                        alternative value for delta and optional for c if delta 
                        is set by options "-r" and "-c". 
                        With these options a new s will be determined. 

                        In addition, you can select parameters n, q and s 
                        manually by using options "-n", "-q", "-s".
                        If you manually select "-n", "-q", "-c"
                        and optionally "-r", parameter s is determined 
                        by these values.

-o,  --out [Filename]  Specifies the output filename.

-k,  --key [Filename]  Specifies the key filename.

-f, --fixseed          Sets seed of pseudo-random-number-generators 
                       to a fixed value.

-r, --delta [value]    Sets per-symbol error probability.
                       Default: delta = 0.01

-c [value]             Sets parameter c.

-n [value]             Sets parameter n.

-l [value]             Sets message length l.
                       Default: l = 128

-q [value]             Sets modulus q.

-s [value]             Sets parameter s.

-p, --plainlength      Instructs the encrypt function to 
                       write the length of the remaining bytes 
                       of the last block as plaintext into the 
                       ciphertext-file.

-v,  --verbose         Prints actual parameters.

-h,  --help            Prints this help.

Key Generation:
===============

Choosing a predefined mode:
---------------------------
"./LWE-Matrix -g MEDIUM -o key-MEDIUM" 

Generates two files: "key-MEDIUM.private" and "key-MEDIUM.public"


Choosing a predefined mode, selecting own delta:
------------------------------------------------
"./LWE-Matrix -g MEDIUM --delta 0.001 -o key-MEDIUM"

Generates two files: "key-MEDIUM.private" and "key-MEDIUM.public", and determines new value for parameter s.


Choosing predefined mode, selecting own delta and parameter c:
--------------------------------------------------------------
"./LWE-Matrix -g MEDIUM --delta 0.01 -c 1.31 -o key-MEDIUM"

Generates two files: "key-MEDIUM.private" and "key-MEDIUM.public", and determines new value for parameter s.


Choosing own value for n, q, l and s (You can exclude l, it is predefined l = 128):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"./LWE-Matrix -g MAN -n 320 -q 4093 -l 64 -s 6.67 -o key-man"

Generates two files: "key-man.private" and "key-man.public"

Choosing own values for n, q, c, l and delta (s is determined by program):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
"LWE-Matrix -g MAN -n 320 -q 4093 -l 64 --delta 0.001 -c 1.22 -o key-man"

Generates two files: "key-man.private" and "key-man.public",
and sets all parameters.


Encryption:
===========

Encrypting a file:
------------------
"LWE-Matrix -e Test.txt -k key-MEDIUM.public -p"

Writes the ciphertext of "Test.txt" into the file "Test.txt.enc" and write
the number of the remaining bytes of the last plaintext block to the front 
of the file "Test.txt.enc".

Encrypting a file and storing the ciphertext in a custom chosen filename:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
"LWE-Matrix -e Test.txt -k key-MEDIUM.public -o Test.ciphertext"

Writes the ciphertext of "Test.txt" into the file "Test.ciphertext".


Decryption:
===========
Decrypting a file:
------------------
"LWE-Matrix -d Test.txt.enc -k key-MEDIUM.private -p"

Writes the plaintext of "Test.txt.enc" into the file "Test.txt".
The number of the remaining bytes of the last plaintext block
are located in the fron of the ciphertext file.

Decrypting a file and storing the plaintext in a custom chosen filename:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"LWE-Matrix -d Test.txt.enc -k key-medium.private -o Test.txt.dec"

Writes the plaintext of "Test.txt.enc" into the file "Test.txt.dec".
